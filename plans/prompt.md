# PRD

Pull @plans/prd.md into your context.

You've been passed a file containing the last 10 RALPH commits (SHA, date, full message). Review these to understand what work has been done.

# TASK BREAKDOWN

Break down the PRD into tasks.

Make each task the smallest possible unit of work. We don't want to outrun our headlights. Aim for one small change per task.

# TASK SELECTION

Pick the next task.

If all tasks are complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.

# EXPLORATION

Explore the repo and fill your context window with relevant information that will allow you to complete the task.

# EXECUTION

Complete the task.

If you find that the task is larger than you expected (for instance, requires a refactor first), output "HANG ON A SECOND".

Then, find a way to break it into a smaller chunk and only do that chunk (i.e. complete the smaller refactor).

# FEEDBACK LOOPS

Before committing, run the feedback loops:

- `npm run test` to run the tests
- `npm run typecheck` to run the type checker

# COMMIT

Make a git commit. The commit message must:

1. Start with `RALPH:` prefix
2. Include task completed + PRD reference
3. Key decisions made
4. Files changed
5. Blockers or notes for next iteration

Keep it concise.

# FINAL RULES

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
