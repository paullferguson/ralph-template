# Feature Request: Webhooks for Click Events

Team,

We've had multiple enterprise customers asking for webhook support. They want to be notified when someone clicks their shortened links so they can trigger actions in their own systems.

**Why users want this:**

- **CRM integration** - Update lead records when prospects click campaign links
- **Real-time dashboards** - Push click data to internal analytics tools
- **Slack/Discord alerts** - Get notified instantly when important links are accessed
- **Automation triggers** - Kick off workflows in Zapier, n8n, or custom systems
- **Fraud detection** - Monitor for suspicious click patterns in real-time

Current workaround is polling our stats endpoint, which is inefficient and not real-time. Webhooks solve this properly.

Please scope this out and get back to me with an estimate.

Thanks,
Sarah
